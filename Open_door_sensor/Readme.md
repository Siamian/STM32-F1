# Open_door_sensor

# Brief
The purpose of this project is to create a door opening sensor. Using the RGB diode, we receive information about opening / closing the door (green -closed, blue-opened, red - change from close to open).

# Software development
To develop firmware for this project following tools were used:

- STM32CubeIDE Version: 1.11.2 Build: 14494_20230119_0724 (UTC)
- STM32 ST-LINK Utility Version 4.6.0.
- Altium Designer Version: 22.10.1 (Build 41)
  
# Microcontroller used:
- STM32F103C8T6 (BLUE PILL)


# The final result
